		<h1>Welcome to my assignments website!</h1>
		<p>
			This was created to fulfil an assignment for my advanced web design class through the school of infomation systems management (IS) at 
			Brigham Young University (BYU). The assignment was accomplished in 4 parts.
			<ol>
				<li>Creating the HTML</li>
				<li>Styling sheet in CSS</li>
				<li>Developing the JavaScript</li>
				<li>Implementing jQuery</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<h2>Creating the HTML</h2>
		<p>
			The HTML code here was all written with an emphasis on syntactical correctness. This means that I needed to have a defined 
			charset, document type, heading tags, etc. This part was simple and was supposed to look simple because there was no styling yet. To 
			give me something to actually write about in the HTML I was asked to pick some kind of web technology to write about. This is presented 
			in the "Frameworks" page. 
		</p>
		<h2>Styling the sheet in CSS</h2>
		<p>
			The CSS code for this website implements useful transitions supported by CSS3. It was written by scratch not using another program 
			to create the styles for me. The "About Me" page shows pictures which slide to the left when you hover over them to reveal a little 
			text blurb. The transitions for that page were done completely in CSS3 with no scripting.
		</p>
		<h2>Developing the JavaScript</h2>
		<p>
			You may have noticed a very annoying popup that shows up again and again only 10 seconds after you have closed it. I'm sorry that you have 
			to deal with that but it was the assigment. I was told to create an HTML popup which provided the option of staying on the current page or 
			going to Google and have it wait 10 seconds before it came again.<br />
			If you want to disable this popup just close it out then click on the yellow "P" in the header. When you do it will change to a blue "X", meaning 
			the popup has been disabled. Click it again if you want it back.<br />
			The other part of this assignment was to make a header and footer which are dynammically inserted into each page. So the green header and footer and 
			the buttons inside of them are inserted into the page by JavaScript and the rest is static text.
		</p>
		<h2>Implementing jQuery</h2>
		<p>
			In this final part of the assignment I was asked to implement some effects and user interface elements into the page using jQuery. I used jQuery to create 
			the accordion style compression and expansion you see in the "Frameworks" page which was not there before. By default the accordion styleing will only let 
			you see one section at a time but if you hit the "Show Multiple Sections" button on the left you can have more than one open at a time. Then use the links 
			below that to navigate to different headings within the page when it gets really long.<br />
			I also recreated the "About Me" page with tabs, resulting in the "About Me Tabs" page. They both have the same content but with different flavors.
		</p>
		<h1>Look Around</h1>
		<p>
			So please feel free to look around and see what you see. I don't have any kinds of secrets so if you find something interesting hit F12 on your keyboard and 
			inspect my code. If you really care to ask me something or just comment you can use the e-mail link at the bottom of the "About Me" page.
		</p>
