		<section id="aboutWater">
			<img id="water" class="inTextImg" src="images/water.JPG" />
			<p>I love water! I am focusing my studies of civil engineering in water resources. This includes water transportation engineering, water treatment facility design, water storage and water quality studies, sediment and contaminant transportation, and anything else that has to do with water resources. The picture here shows the Burrones Dam near Guanajuato Mexico. I did a study abroad there and studied the watershed area which feeds that dam.</p>

		<section id="aboutGis">
			<img id="gis" class="inTextImg" src="images/gis.jpg" />
			<p>A big part of water resource engineering is the use of GIS based applications to create models of how water may flow in channels, on the surface, or under ground. I love studying GIS technology and writing programs and applications to do new things, especially in an online environment. My thesis research included a study of current virtual globe technology and an implementation of these virtual globes for GIS processing in a cloud environment.</p>
